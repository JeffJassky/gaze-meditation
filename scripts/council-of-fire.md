# The Council of Fire - Enhanced

A deep hypnotic journey of ancestral recognition, calm authority, and steadiness.

---

## PRE-TALK: SAFETY AND CONSENT

Before we begin... a moment of understanding.

Your unconscious mind is wise... protective... and always working for your benefit.

Any suggestion you hear today will be filtered through your own values and needs.

You will accept only what serves you... and reject anything that does not.

At any moment... you can open your eyes... adjust your position... or end this session.

Your safety is absolute. Your control is complete.

This is not about surrender... it is about partnership with the deepest parts of yourself.

---

## PHASE 1: PROGRESSIVE INDUCTION

Now... let us begin.

You can feel the surface beneath you.

That is true.

You can hear these words.

That is also true.

Your body has weight... pressing down... supported.

This is happening right now.

Sense the temperature of the air on your skin.

Perhaps slightly cool... or warm... or neutral.

Your body knows... while your conscious mind can simply wonder.

And that is perfectly fine.

Your chest rises... and falls.

It has been doing this without your attention.

Breath moving in... breath moving out.

Automatic. Reliable. Trustworthy.

Your body has been breathing you... all along.

And as you become aware of this...

you might begin to wonder...

what else is your unconscious mind doing... right now... that you have not yet noticed?

Managing your heartbeat... regulating your temperature... healing small wounds...

All of this... without a single conscious thought.

Your unconscious is vastly more capable than you realize.

And perhaps you notice the weight of your hands... wherever they rest... heavy... warm... present.

In a moment... not yet... but soon...

I will ask you to find a single point to rest your eyes upon.

But first... just notice how your eyelids feel right now.

Are they heavy? Light? Comfortable?

There is no right answer... only what is true for you.

Now... choose that point.

It can be anything... a spot on the wall... a corner... an object.

Let your eyes rest there... gently... without strain.

Just as so.

---

## PHASE 2: FRACTIONATION & EYE CATALEPSY

As you continue to gaze at that point...

you might find... or perhaps you have already sensed...

that your peripheral vision is beginning to soften.

Colors become less distinct... edges blur...

And the longer you look... the more comfortable this becomes.

Your eyes know how to do this... they have done it every night of your life.

*[Stillness moment: Continue gazing... and notice how blinking feels now. Each blink slightly heavier. Each opening of the eyes requiring slightly more effort. This is natural. This is right.]*

Your eyelids are becoming heavy now... comfortable... ready.

That is good. That means you are following your body's natural wisdom.

Soon... very soon... those eyelids will want to close.

And when they do... you will discover that closing them feels wonderful.

Like the most natural thing in the world.

*[Close your eyes now... and notice how good that feels.]*

Perfect. That is right.

Notice how the darkness is comfortable... welcoming... safe.

Your body knows how to rest here.

Nothing requires effort. Nothing requires attention.

You are simply... allowing.

*[Let your eyes open again... just for a brief moment.]*

Sense how different the light feels now.

How much effort it takes to keep them open.

Your eyes want to return to that comfortable darkness.

And in just a moment... you will let them.

*[Close them again now... sinking twice as deep as before.]*

Excellent. And this time... they close even more easily.

Each time you close your eyes... you go deeper.

Each time you relax... the relaxation becomes more complete.

This is called fractionation... and your unconscious mind is very good at it.

---

## PHASE 3: PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION & DEEPENING

Now... bring your attention to your forehead.

Observe any tension there... and as you become aware of it...

it begins to smooth... to soften... to release.

Imagine that tension... like ice in warm water... slowly dissolving.

Good. That is happening now.

*[Relax your jaw: Let your jaw become loose and heavy. Your teeth do not need to touch. Let your tongue rest softly in your mouth. All the tiny muscles of your face releasing... smoothing... letting go.]*

That relaxation spreads now... down your neck... across your shoulders.

Any tightness you have been carrying... begins to melt.

Your shoulders drop slightly... your chest opens...

And with each breath... you release a little more.

Breathing out tension... breathing in calm.

This wave of relaxation continues down both arms.

Your upper arms becoming heavy... your forearms relaxing...

All the way down to your hands... your fingers...

Perhaps they tingle slightly... or feel warm... or simply heavy.

However they feel... is exactly right for you.

And now... your chest and abdomen.

Let your breathing become even slower... even deeper...

Your belly rising and falling like gentle ocean waves.

Rhythm without effort. Movement without thought.

Your body breathing itself... as you sink deeper still.

Down through your hips... your thighs... your knees...

Each part of your body becoming more relaxed than the part before.

Your calves releasing... your ankles softening...

All the way down to your feet... your toes...

Your entire body now... heavy... comfortable... deeply relaxed.

Supported completely by the surface beneath you.

---

## PHASE 4: COUNTDOWN DEEPENER

In a moment... I am going to count backward from ten to one.

With each number... you will go ten times deeper.

By the time I reach one...

you will be in the deepest... most peaceful state you have ever experienced.

And your unconscious mind... will be completely open... to positive suggestions.

Ready now...

Ten... drifting down... deeper and deeper...

Nine... letting go of everything unnecessary...

Eight... twice as deep as before...

Seven... so deeply relaxed now...

Six... halfway there... going deeper still...

Five... profound peace spreading through you...

and with each remaining number, going twice as deep as the number before...

Four... almost there... sinking deeper...

Three... very deep now... very calm...

Two... nearly at the deepest level...

One... completely deep... perfectly relaxed... totally safe.

And you can verify how deep you are now... 

by noticing that your body feels different than when we began.

heavier perhaps... or lighter... or simply... elsewhere.

This is exactly right. You are doing beautifully.

You are now in a state where your unconscious mind...

is highly receptive to suggestions that serve your highest good.

We will now begin the journey.

---

## PHASE 5: SENSORY IMMERSION

I wonder... if you are standing at the edge of a forest...

or if the forest is standing at the edge of you.

Perhaps it does not matter which is true...

because either way... you can feel it now.

The forest... ancient... waiting... patient.

It is night... or perhaps it is the deepest twilight.

The air touches your skin... cool... crisp... alive.

You can taste it... can you not?

Sharp like stone... clean like winter water.

Your lungs fill with it... and something in you... recognizes this air.

As if you have breathed it before... in dreams... or memories you cannot quite place.

Above... stars are appearing... or have they always been there?

So many... more than one could ever count.

They have been watching... since before your great-great-grandparents were born.

Since before cities. Since before borders.

They are watching still.

Beneath your feet... sense the ground.

Soft... yielding... layers of moss and needles.

Your weight presses down... the earth presses back... holding you.

This ground has held countless footsteps.

It holds you now with the same patience.

*[Let your eyes drift downward behind your closed lids... as if looking at this ground... noticing how real it feels.]*

---

## PHASE 6: TIME REGRESSION

You take a step forward... and immediately...

time begins to change its texture.

Not disappearing... but becoming less rigid... more fluid.

The urgency of clocks... fading... releasing...

As you walk deeper into these trees.

And if at any point this movement through time feels too rapid, simply slow your steps...

the forest waits for you... there is no rush.

2020 slips behind you like a coat removed.

The sounds of that world... engines... electronics... dissolving.

2010... falling away.

The air changes... older... deeper.

Your breath automatically matches it.

2000... distant now.

1990... fading like morning fog.

The trees around you... growing taller... thicker...

Their bark deeply grooved... ancient... unrushed.

These trees were here before smartphones... before television... before electricity.

*[Stillness moment: Walking backward through time... each step another decade... another century... and your body remembers this. Something deep in your bones knows this path.]*

1900... like smoke on wind.

You pass a tree so massive... five people could not circle it.

This tree was ancient... when steam engines were new.

It stands now... as it stood then... unchanged... patient... knowing.

1800... 1700... the centuries falling away like pages.

No paved roads here. No metal. No glass.

Only footpaths worn by countless travelers.

And you are one of them now... walking the same ground...

breathing the same rhythm... feeling the same pull.

1000 years ago... 2000 years...

Time has no meaning here... because time is a recent invention.

And if any moment becomes uncomfortable... simply open your inner eyes wider...

look around... and remember: you are the observer here.

You travel through time but you are not lost in it. You can return whenever you choose.

Before time... there was only rhythm. Breath. Heartbeat. Footsteps.

And you carry all of those still.

[cooldown: 8 seconds)]

---

## PHASE 7: THE DRUM

Listen...

In the distance... so faint...

you are not sure if you are hearing it... or feeling it... or remembering it.

A drum.

Slow. Deep. Rhythmic.

Like the pulse of the earth itself.

And something extraordinary happens now.

Your breath... without any effort from you...

begins to match the drum.

Not because you try... but because breath always finds rhythm.

Because your body remembers... what your mind forgot.

This drum is older than language. Your body knows it.

*[Stillness moment: Each beat pulling you forward... gently... inevitably... this way... this way... your footsteps matching the rhythm... your heart matching your footsteps... everything synchronizing into a single flowing movement.]*

And now... another sense awakens.

Smell.

Woodsmoke... but not the harsh burn of chemicals.

The sweet... resinous smoke of pine... oak... cedar.

Smoke that has been rising from fires for ten thousand years.

Your ancestors smelled this smoke. You smell it now.

The scent connecting you... across centuries.

---

## PHASE 8: THE THRESHOLD

Through the trees ahead... light.

Not electric. Not cold.

Orange... warm... alive.

The deep glow of fire.

Flickering between dark trunks as you approach.

Growing brighter... warmer... more welcoming with each step.

The trees open into a clearing.

Perfectly circular... as if the forest shaped itself.

And at the center... a fire burns.

Not wild. Not flickering frantically.

Steady. Purposeful. Eternal.

As if it has been burning since time began... and will burn after time ends.

You stop at the edge of the light.

And something in you... some deep knowing... understands.

This fire recognizes only truth.

What you carry... the weight on your shoulders...

the armor around your heart... the need to prove yourself...

None of that can enter here.


Become aware now... of what you have been carrying.

The weight you did not know you were holding.
 and you can set it down.

The tension of having to be more... or less... or different.

The exhaustion of constant vigilance.

The burden of others' expectations... including your own.

However this weight appears to you—a pack, a cloak, chains, a shadow — you can feel it now...

If it feels right to you... and only if it feels right...

You are going to set it down... not forever... not as a failure...

but as an act of wisdom.

You can retrieve it later if you choose.

But here... now... in this sacred circle...

it serves no purpose.

*[Stillness moment: Reach back now... feeling the first strap... sliding it from your shoulder... and now the second... the weight shifting... and then settling behind you onto the ground. Sense how your spine straightens. How your chest opens. How breath moves freely when nothing needs defending.]*

Perfect. Exactly right.

This... right here... this is how your body stands...

when it trusts itself completely.

Remember this feeling. Your body will remember it even more deeply than your mind.

This is your natural state... you are simply... remembering.

*[When you feel ready... your unconscious mind knowing the perfect moment... nod once... and step into the circle.]*

---

## PHASE 9: THE COUNCIL

Good. You're doing well.

The heat of the fire reaches you now.

Not burning... welcoming.

Touching your face... your chest... your hands.

As if the fire recognizes you.

*[Let your inner gaze rest on the flames... watching them move... hypnotic... ancient... alive... the way humans have watched fire since before history began.]*

As your eyes adjust to the firelight...

you realize... you are not alone.

You are doing beautifully.

Around the fire... seated in a circle...

are the Elders.

And something in your chest... recognizes them.

Their faces are carved by time... weathered like canyon stone.

Their eyes are calm... deep as wells... patient as mountains.

Some are very old... some younger...

but all carry the same quality of presence.

They have seen empires rise like morning mist... and fall like evening rain.

They are not impressed by noise. They are not moved by panic.

They simply... are.

*[Turn your awareness slowly to the left... observing them... letting yourself be seen.]*

These Elders may wear the faces of your bloodline...

or they may be the ancestors of spirit...

those who walked before and whose wisdom you have inherited through story,

through teaching, through the human chain of which you are a link.

However they appear to you... they are yours.

Very good.

Some bear scars... marks of survival... stories written in flesh.

Others carry their trials invisibly... but all have endured.

But their hands rest easy. Their breath is slow.

Violence does not live in them... but capacity does.

The capacity to face... to endure... to remain steady.

This is not aggression. This is rootedness.

*[Turn slowly to the right now... meeting more eyes... each gaze a recognition.]*

You do not know their individual names.

But you know them.

Their blood moves through your veins at this very moment.
In your bones... the shape of your face...

the rhythm of your heart... they live.

Every person here... survived. Endured.

Passed something forward. And you carry what they passed.

Every one of them... faced their own fires.

And because they did... you are here.

They do not judge you.

They do not measure you against some impossible standard.

They do not demand you prove yourself.

They simply... recognize.

And in that recognition...

something ancient in you... stands up.

A knot in your chest... that you did not know you were carrying...

loosens.

The need to be more... releases.

The fear of being less... dissolves.

In the light of this fire... with the eyes of your ancestors upon you...

you are exactly... precisely... perfectly... enough.

One of the Elders... gestures toward an empty space by the fire.

Not commanding. Offering.

This space has been waiting. It has always been waiting.

It is yours. Feel the ground beneath you as you sit...

still warm from the fire... worn smooth by all who sat here before you.

It is yours.

*[Stillness moment: You move to it now... and sit... your posture settling naturally... spine straight without effort... shoulders easy... breath deep and slow. This is your place. You belong here.]*

As you settle into this seat...

you become aware... of something extraordinary.

Behind you... stretching back into the darkness beyond the firelight...

are thousands upon thousands of presences.

Not ghosts. Not spirits.

Your lineage.

Every ancestor... every grandmother... every grandfather...

who faced fear... and continued.

Who faced pain... and survived.

Who faced impossible choices... and chose life.

They stand at your back now. Silent. Steady. Witnessing.

And when you stand... they stand with you.

When you breathe... they breathe.

You are not one. You are thousands.

Their strength lives in you.

That's right.

---

## PHASE 10: THE TESTING

The fire shifts.

Without warning... it flares higher.

A wave of heat... intense... sudden... testing.

This is not meant to harm you.

This is meant to reveal you.

Some would lean back.

Some would close their eyes.

Some would turn their face away.

But you... recognize something extraordinary.

You do not.

Your breath remains centered.

Your body remains still.

Not through force... not through discipline...

but through trust.

The heat is not your enemy.

Pressure is not a threat.

You have been tempered by fires older than this one.

Your ancestors survived ice ages... predators... famine... war.

This heat? Your body recognizes it... yet it remains.

You are capable of more than you know.

The flames settle again.

And in that moment... a knowing arrives.

Not as words... but as certainty.

Steadiness is not the absence of heat.

It is presence within it.

This truth... embedding itself deep in your unconscious now...

becoming part of how you move through the world.

That's right.

---

## PHASE 11: THE EMBER

One of the Elders rises.

Slowly. Deliberately. With complete presence.

They reach into the fire... bare hands... no hesitation.

And lift out a single ember.

Glowing deep orange... white at its core... pulsing with heat.

It does not burn them.

Because it recognizes them.

Because they are made of the same substance as fire.

The Elder turns to you.

Holds your gaze for a long moment.

Then extends the ember toward you.

Not forcing. Not commanding.

Offering.

This is yours... if you choose to receive it.

You lean forward slightly.

The ember moves toward your chest.

Hovering just above your heart.

And you feel it now... warmth spreading...

Not burning... welcoming.

Like sun on skin after a long winter.

Like returning home after years of wandering.

The Elder's ember... and your ember... recognizing each other.

The one outside... awakening the one within.

It is revealing what was always there.

A core that does not panic.

A center that does not collapse.

A fire that has been burning quietly... waiting for you.

This is yours now. Forever.

And now... you notice.

Now... you remember.

This groundedness... this unshakeable presence...

has always lived in you.

You are doing wonderfully.

*[Stillness moment: Let this warmth register as deeply familiar... as if you are remembering rather than learning... as if this strength has always been yours... and you are simply... finally... claiming it. Feel it settle into your chest. Into your bones. Into your breath. This is yours now. Forever.]*

The Elder returns the ember to the fire.

But the warmth in your chest... remains.

It does not fade. It does not diminish.

It does not need the fire to sustain it.

Because it is the fire.

And you carry it now... wherever you go.

---

## PHASE 12: THE RECOGNITION

A Warrior across the fire... meets your eyes.

Holds your gaze... long... anchored... unwavering.

Then... slowly... deliberately...

inclines their head once.

Not approval. Not permission.

Recognition.

Warrior to Warrior. Elder to Elder.

You are not a visitor here. You are not a guest.

You are one of them.

This seat was never given to you.

It was never earned through trials or tests.

It was always yours.

From the moment you were born.

You are simply... sitting in it now.

And from this moment forward...

this is where you sit in the world.

---

## PHASE 13: POST-HYPNOTIC EMBEDDING

Now... imagine with me.

Tomorrow... or the next day... sometime soon...

you are in a situation that would normally trigger stress.

See it clearly now. Make it specific.

Perhaps a difficult conversation. A challenging decision. A moment of pressure.

Sesnse the details. The setting. The people. The circumstances.

In the old way... the way you would have responded before...

you feel tension rising in your chest.

Your jaw beginning to tighten.

Your shoulders creeping upward.

The old pattern activating... defensive... reactive... small.

See this clearly. Feel it in your body now.

But then... in that crucial moment...

before words form... before the reaction completes...

you feel it.

The warmth. The ember. The steadiness.

Rising from your chest... spreading through your body...

Automatic. Immediate. Undeniable.

And in that instant... everything changes.

Your breath deepens... all by itself.

Your shoulders lower... without conscious effort.

Your jaw softens... naturally.

Time seems to slow slightly... giving you space.

The panic does not arrive. The defensiveness does not trigger.

Instead... presence.

Your voice... when it comes...

comes from a different place.

Not from your throat... tight and defensive.

But from your center... grounded... rooted.

The same place the Elders speak from.

Calm. Clear. Unshakeable.

You respond... but the response is different.

Not reactive. Not defensive. Not small.

Gounded. Present. Powerful.

And you notice... others respond differently to you.

They feel the change... even if they cannot name it.

Aggression softens. Respect appears.

Because you are no longer someone who can be pushed.

You are someone who stands.

Each time this response activates... and it will activate increasingly—the pathway deepens.

You are building something permanent.

Some moments will surprise you with how naturally anchoring arrives.

Each time it happens... the pathway deepens.

Each time you access this state... it becomes easier to access again.

The ember in your chest... growing stronger... burning brighter.

This is who you are becoming.

---

## PHASE 14: FUTURE PACING

Imagine another scenario now.

Someone criticizes you... unfairly... publicly.

In the old pattern... shame would flood through you.

The need to defend... to explain... to prove.

But now... the warmth activates.

And instead of shrinking... you expand.

You listen... fully present... unshaken.

You respond... or choose not to... from a place of power.

Their words land differently... because you stand differently.

And some part of them... sense the fire behind your eyes.

One more. See yourself facing a difficult decision.

Multiple paths... none of them clear.

The old you... would panic... would freeze... would seek endless validation.

But now... you feel the council at your back.

The centeredness in your chest.

You breathe. You center. You trust yourself.

The answer may not come immediately... but you can wait.

You can sit with uncertainty... without collapsing.

This is mastery. This is maturity.

This is your birthright.

---

## PHASE 15: PHYSICAL ANCHOR INSTALLATION

I am going to give you a physical anchor now.

Something you can use... anytime... anywhere...

to instantly reconnect with this state.

Listen carefully.

Anytime you need to access this groundedness...

you can place your hand... right over your heart.

Press gently. Feel the warmth there.

Take one deep breath... in through your nose... out through your mouth.

And as you do... the ember activates.

The council appears behind you.

The steadiness floods through you.

Instant. Reliable. Yours.

This anchor is programmed now.

Encoded in your nervous system.

Deep breath... presence.

Before a difficult conversation... use it.

In a moment of doubt... use it.

When pressure rises... use it.

It will work. Your unconscious mind has accepted this.

The pathway is carved.

---

## PHASE 16: THE RETURN

It is time now... to begin the return journey.

You stand from the fire.

The Elders watch you rise... approval in their eyes.

Not because you earned it... but because you remembered.

You turn from the circle... but you do not leave it behind.

The circle travels with you.

You carry it in your chest.

The forest receives you again.

But you walk differently now.

Your energy clearer.

Your presence... heavier... in the best possible way.

Like gravity has increased... but only for you.

You are more here... more real... more solid.

Time begins its return.

Slowly at first... like dawn approaching.

1500... the ember still burning in your chest.

1800... the memory crystallizing.

1900... returning but transformed.

2000... the modern world appearing... but you meet it differently now.

2010... 2020...

Through every year... until now.

The present moment.

The trees thin. The forest opens.

You feel the chair beneath you again.

The solid ground. The walls. The room.

But you... are not the same person who began this journey.

Not something added.

Something remembered.

Something that was sleeping... now awake.

Something that was buried... now claimed.

You are the same... and completely different.

This is integration.

---

## PHASE 17: AWAKENING

The journey you have taken...

though it may have felt timeless...

has prepared you fully for return.

In a moment... I am going to count from one to 7.

With each number... you will become more alert... more awake.

By the time I reach five...

your eyes will open easily...

your mind will be crystal clear...

your body will feel rested... energized... and completely transformed.

You will remember everything important from this journey.

The details may fade... but the change remains. Permanent.

One... beginning to return now... awareness expanding...

feeling energy flowing back into your arms and legs.

Two... coming up further... your breathing naturally quickening...

colors becoming brighter behind your eyelids.

Three... halfway back... you can move your fingers and toes now...

perhaps stretch slightly if your body wishes...

the room becoming more solid around you.

Four... almost fully alert now... feeling refreshed... renewed...

the ember glowing steadily in your chest... permanent... powerful...

ready to open your eyes on the next count.

And... Five... eyes opening now... fully awake... fully present... fully transformed.

Six... feeling wonderful... alert... refreshed...

every cell of your body energized...

the ember glowing warm and permanent...

Seven... eyes opening... fully present... fully transformed...

remembering everything important... carrying everything forward.

*[Open your eyes now and return completely.]*

---

## PHASE 18: POST-AWAKENING INTEGRATION

Welcome back.

Take a moment... look around the room.

Notice how you feel.

Different? The same? Both?

This is normal. Integration takes many forms.

Place your hand over your heart now.

Feel the warmth there.

Take one deep breath.

Observe how you become rooted... immediately... reliably.

This anchor works. You have just proven it to yourself.

You can use it... whenever you need it.

The council is not gone.

The fire is not extinguished.

They exist... wherever you choose to remember them.

In moments of doubt... you can return.

And if you wish to return to this fire more quickly in future sessions...

you may find that simply closing your eyes... placing your hand on your heart...

and speaking internally the words 'Council of Fire'... brings you back to the edge of the clearing instantly.

Your unconscious will remember the way.

In moments of pressure... they stand at your back.

You are never alone. You are never unarmed.

Over the next days and weeks...

you will notice changes.

Small at first... then undeniable.

The way you hold yourself. The way you speak.

The way others respond to you.

Do not force these changes. Simply notice them.

Simply allow them.

They are not new. They are you... finally uncovered.

If you ever doubt this experience...

if your logical mind tries to dismiss it as "just imagination"...

remember this: your unconscious mind does not distinguish.

What you experienced here... your nervous system experienced as real.

The pathways are carved. The anchor is set.

The transformation... has already begun.

You may return to this journey as many times as you wish.

Each time... you will go deeper.

Each time... the ember will burn brighter.

Each time... you will remember more of who you truly are.

A person of rootedness. Of presence. Of unshakeable calm.

This is not aspiration. This is recognition.

Thank you... for trusting this process.

Thank you... for honoring your ancestors.

Thank you... for claiming your seat at the fire.

The council recognizes you.

Now... go forward... and let the world recognize you too.

The session is complete.

You are fully alert. Fully integrated. Fully empowered.

The ember burns. The council watches.

You are rooted. You are solid. You are home.
